# Welcome!

Welcome to the world of HTML üññüßë‚Äçüíª

## üí¨ Fundamentals:

We have prepared these exercises for anyone interested in learning HTML from scratch. During this course we will go over the following concepts:

1. Get familiar with a good deal of the most popular HTML Tags.

2. Using the tags together to create a simple HTML Website.

3. Linking websites together using Anchors with Relative or Absolute paths.

4. The HTML audio and video tag.

> üîπ We built the exercises incrementally, you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.

Note: Don't get frustrated!
